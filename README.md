# Soapbox

Soapbox is a drop in blogging module for Kohana.

This module has a very limited focus. Probably only useful for personal blogging.

## Syntax Highlighting

If the [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) CLI tool can be found on your server by
running `which pygmentize` then source code that you enclose in fenced code
blocks, `~~~` will be highlighted. Optionally you can specify the file extension
by adding it after the opening code fence. (e.g. `~~~ php`, `~~~ rb`, etc...).
For a full list of supported file extensions view the available
[lexers](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/).
